# terminal-ai
access ai from your terminal by starting command with 'ai', followed up with your question.


# How To Set Up

when you have cloned the repo,
write in console while in root directory:
"chmod +x index.js"
then after that do:
npm link


This will make the word "ai" work for calling ai, just as cd works for navigating folders and ls does for writing out folders

when you first write "ai" in the console, you will initialize a setup,
so have your API Token at hand.
